# OrdinaryDifferentialEquations-pyPlot

Using matplotlib's pyplot for visualizing the heat dissipation in a metal bar. Different lines mean different time stamps. X Axis represents the points of the one dimmensional bar, and Y Axis represents the temperature.

In this one, we have a heating point in the left side of the bar, and a cooling point on the right side.

In this one, a single heating / cooling point, with random heating / cooling charges.

In this one, a single point that heats, then cools.
